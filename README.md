About the Project:
Ignite App is the work of Team Ignite where they focus on solving a specific problem given by the organizers of Old St.Labs during the 2023 Hackathon.


## Purpose of the Application
The Organizers let us chose a world that solves a unique problem in theme with Pop Culture.

Our theme for the hackathon is Cyberpunk.

Why Cyberpunk?
In the cyberpunk universe, the Philippines or New Philippines is a country that suffers from cultural identity loss, due to the fast technology advancement the culture itself deteriorates and Team Ignite wants to change that.
